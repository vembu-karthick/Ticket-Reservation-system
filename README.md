## Features

* **User Registration & Login**:
  Users can create an account by providing their **username**, **password**, and **email**. Once registered, they can log in with their credentials to access their account.
  After logging in, users can:

  * **View and Edit Profile**: Users can see and modify their profile details, like their username and email.
  * **Check PNR Status**: Users can check the **PNR status** of their booked tickets to see the current status (whether the ticket is confirmed, waitlisted, or canceled).
  * **Upcoming & Completed Journeys**: Users can view a history of all their bookings. This includes upcoming trips (booked tickets for future dates) and completed journeys (tickets from past trips).

* **Train Availability**:
  Users can search for available trains between two stations by selecting the **source station** and **destination station**.
  The system will display all the available trains that run between the selected stations, including:

  * **Train number**
  * **Departure and arrival times**
  * **Available seats** in different classes (First Class, Second Class, Third Class)

  This helps users to quickly check which trains are available for their planned journey.

* **Ticket Booking**:
  Users can book tickets between the selected source and destination. They can:

  * **Choose from Three Classes**: Users can select between **First Class**, **Second Class**, and **Third Class** based on their preference and budget.
  * **Seat Allocation**: After selecting the class, users are assigned a **berth** (a seat) in the chosen class. Once a ticket is booked, the system confirms the booking and assigns a unique **PNR number**.
  * **PNR Status**: Users can always check the **PNR status** of their ticket after booking, which will display details like:

    * **Train number**
    * **Date of journey**
    * **Seat status** (whether the ticket is confirmed, in waitlist, or canceled)

* **Ticket Cancellation**:
  Users can cancel their ticket if their plans change. Once canceled, the seat will become available for other users to book.
  The cancellation process also ensures that:

  * If the ticket was on the **waitlist**, the **next user in line** on the waitlist will be automatically allocated the berth once itâ€™s canceled.
  * The system updates the available seats accordingly, ensuring that no berth is left unused.
